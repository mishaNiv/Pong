# Pong
A game where a ball is falling and the player's goal is to not let it touch the ground using a bar they can slide with the arrow keys. The ball is constantly moving and bouncing off the bar and walls and the player only has 3 lives; once the ball touches the ground 3 times, the game is over and the player loses.
